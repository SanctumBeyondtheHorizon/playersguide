Sanctum Beyond the Horizon is a science-fantasy Pathfinder Second Edition Living World Campaign. A living world campaign is one where the characters persist in a shared environment across multiple sessions with a variety of GMs as well as text roleplay hosted in our Discord server. Sanctum Beyond the Horizon is explicitly a welcoming space for players of marginalized demographics. Bigotry of any kind will not be tolerated. We hope you enjoy your adventures with us!

## Community Guidelines

{{margin-top}}

1. **Respect Each Other**
Sanctum is a place where people of all nationalities, religions, genders and orientations come together to enjoy Pathfinder Second Edition. Bigotry and disrespect are not tolerated. Out of Character Conflicts will be handled through a ticket with staff or off of server.

{{margin-top}}

2. **Age and Mature content**
This is strictly an 18+ campaign. Similarly, all characters must be clearly depicted as adults for their age. This is a zero tolerance policy. Sexual content is limited under our Prohibited Topics. Generalized jokes and references, as well as brief mentions of the relations of the characters are acceptable. Anything else falls under our Prohibited Topics.

{{margin-top}}

3. **Prohibited Topics**
The following topics are not permitted on the server.
- Sexual Violence
- Real World Politics
- Excessive Descriptions of Obscenity

{{margin-top}}

4. **Managing Player Conflicts**
Out of Character conflicts are inevitable. But they must be handled respectfully. In the event of an OOC Conflict, attempt to resolve it in DMs if you feel safe to. Otherwise #create-a-ticket and staff will attempt to assist with a resolution. Not all player conflicts will warrant a response, but for those that do, we will do our best to ensure an agreeable solution for all parties.

{{margin-top}}

5. **Duplicate Accounts**
You may only use one account and one set of characters per player. 

{{margin-top}}

6. **Extenuating Circumstances**
There will be events that may not fall under any of the existing rules. In all circumstances, follow staff guidance. In urgent scenarios such as obvious spam, blatant abuse, and only then, pinging @Moderator and @Admin is acceptable. Otherwise, #create-a-ticket and await a response.

## Roleplay Guidelines

{{margin-top:20px;}}

1. **Don't Be Obscene**
There are to be no in depth descriptions of sexual and mature content. Additionally, depictions of violence should be kept to a cinematic level. Excessive depictions of violence are not allowed.

{{margin-top}}

2. **Reflavoring Character Options**
Due to the nature of a living world server, Sanctum has restrictions for how far a character option can be reflavored. A spade is a spade and must be used as such, however, a war ax or hammer can have embellishments that make it reminiscent of a shovel. Similarly, spell manifestations always incorporate sigils that clearly indicate the spell being used for purposes of Identify a Spell. Otherwise, the exact appearance is flexible. If a particular instance of relfavoring is questionable, #create-a-ticket. 

{{margin-top}}

3. **Using the Roleplay Channels**
The #sanctum-sessions forum channel is for roleplay scenes between two or more characters. These are scenes that take place in specific locations and times not represented by the open roleplay channels. They will be listed as Open, Closed, or Ask.

{{margin-top}}

Open RP forums can be joined by anyone at any time. Closed RP forums can only be joined by those on the whitelist at the top post. Do not ask to join these forums. Forum posts labeled Ask have a whitelist of allowed players. If you wish to join an Ask RP thread, ping the active roleplayers in #ask-to-rp. You can also use that channel to post small blurbs or topics to pique interest to generate a scene.

{{margin-top}}

The remaining channels are open roleplay channels that follow the flow of real world time. These channels are open for anyone to join at any time and progress according to server time. Sanctum follows a day night cycle that aligns with the time zone of Eastern US, EST and EDT. This is Server Time.

4. **Share the Spotlight**

Whether in game or text roleplay, passing the spotlight is an important tool. Monologues and drabbles are great ways to flesh out your character, and should be posted in #sanctum-roleplay with the Drabble tag. In scenes with multiple characters, each message or action should end by passing the spotlight back to another player. This creates an  active flow that will lead the scene to a satisfying conclusion.

5. **Text Roleplay Etiquette**

Text roleplay needs to be written in a semi literate fashion and legible. Semi literate writing is in full sentences with mostly proper punctuation. Grammar and spelling errors are allowed, nobody is perfect. Nonstandard fonts are an accessibility issue and are never allowed. Emotes, emoticons, and links are always considered Out of Character. Dice rolls must be kept to #dice-rolls-rp
- Actions should be formatted in italics.
- Thoughts should be 'italicized and placed in single quotes.'
- Speech should be "placed in quotation marks"
- Out of character talk should be kept to a minimum and kept between || Spoiler Bars||

6. **In Character Conflict**

Many times the best roleplay puts characters at odds with each other. Sometimes however, players may not have the same goals for a particular instance of character conflict, especially in ones where dice are rolled and damage is dealt. Players looking to create in character conflicts are required to use a thread in #conflict-consent to discuss the scope of the conflict with their roleplay partner. In cases where a scene devolves into conflict unexpectedly, players are required to pause and check in with their roleplay partner in a thread in #conflict-consent.

## Gameplay Guidelines

**1. Metagaming**

Metagaming comes in two major forms; Constructive, and Disruptive. 

Constructive Metagaming includes; intentionally engaging with the material the GM has prepared, communicating with your party members, and acting on information you know out of character to be false that your character might consider true. Constructive metagaming improves the flow of the game, ensures your party coordinates well, and improves immersion.

Disruptive Metagaming includes; demanding other players act in specific ways, looking up monsters stat blocks in the middle of the game, and acting on out of character information your character does not know in ways that lead to a negative play experience.

Constructive metagaming is allowed and encouraged, especially in the case of engaging in the material a GM has prepared. Disruptive metagaming is unacceptable.


**2. Consistency**

If you are scheduled for a game, you are expected to show up or give notice to the GM as soon as you know you won't make it. Life happens, so absences are acceptable. However, avoid doing it too often, and communicate your circumstances where possible. If you level up in between signing up for a game and the day of the game, you must inform your GM.

**3. Turn Length**

Plan your turns ahead of time. If the encounter significantly changes immediately before your turn, a slightly longer time is acceptable. Typically, your turn should not exceed two minutes to resolve.

**4. Acting in Character**

When possible, you should be taking the actions that make the most sense for your character. However, if "it's what my character would do" would be disruptive to the game, exercise Constructive Metagaming instead and ensure a positive gaming experience for the others at the table.

## Interpreting the Rules

When interpreting the rules, there are two major paradigms, following the rules as they are written, and the rules as they are intended. 

**Rules as Written**

Following the rules as written is following the rules to the exact letter.

**Rules as Intended**

Following rules as intended is interpreting the developers intent behind the rules.

**Rules as Sanctum**

Overly relying on one or the other paradigm can lead to a negative player experience. Sanctum trends towards a rules as written interpretation. However, significant exceptions will be listed in #rulings-and-faq. Additionally, GMs are encouraged to rule in favor of the players when the rules are in question. However, in cases where player behavior is deemed to be cheesy or otherwise contributing to a negative experience for others at the table, then the rules as written will be strictly enforced.

## Starting Out

All characters begin at Level 1 with 15 gp to spend on equipment. All common ancestries, heritages, backgrounds, classes, skills, skill feats, and level 0 equipment are available for purchase. Level 0 uncommon weapons and armor are available for purchase as well. See the #allow-list for more details.

## Approving Uncommon Options

If you wish to use an Uncommon or Rare option, use the  #create-a-ticket channel and submit the name of the option as well as an Archives of Nethys link, if it exists, or a screenshot of Demiplane or Pathbuilder if it does not.

## Legacy Character Options

If a character option or item has been reprinted identically whether in name or function, the remastered version must be used. In the case where legacy options are no longer functional from referencing outdated material, they can no longer be used. If a legacy option has not been reprinted in any way, then it may be used until further notice.

## Sanctum Bonus Feats

Every Sanctum character receives an additional feat at 2nd-Level that must be spent on an Archetype Dedication feat. Additional class feats are granted at 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th level. 

## Character Sheet

Build your character in pathbuilder2e. If you have the paid version, add Sanctum Bonus feats via the custom feats option in the sidebar. Otherwise, add them in the Notes section. 

## Backstory

Your character’s backstory should be no longer than a few paragraphs and should answer the following questions.
Where do they come from?
How did they come to Sanctum?
What is their attitude towards the galactic empire? 

\column

## Character Submissions

When you’re ready to submit your character follow the instructions in #create-a-ticket. A private channel will open at the bottom of the channel list. Post a link to your character sheet in that channel. A staff member will review your character sheet when available.

## Level 1 Rebuilds
While a character is 1st-level, you may submit a new character sheet. They  retain any experience gained, if any.
